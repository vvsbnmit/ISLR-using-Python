# ISLR-using-Python

I have created this repository to implement the concept of ISLR using Python. ISLR is the goto book for someone who is starting their journey in the field of Statistical Modelling.

The Data folder contains the data sets used in the text book.

I have created one notebook per chapter which will include the brief description of key takeaways from that chapter and the python codes which are equivalent to the R codes explained in the Lab section of the textbook.
